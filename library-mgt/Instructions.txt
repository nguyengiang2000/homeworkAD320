Guide on What to Do:
App.js:
State Initialization: Initialize the state with an array of books.
addBook Function: Implement the addBook function to add new books to the state.
Props Passing: Pass the books array to the Books component and the addBook function to the AddBook component as props.

Books.js:
Render Books: Implement the map function to iterate over the books array (passed via props) and display each bookâ€™s title and author.

AddBook.js:
State Management: Implement state management for the title and author input fields.
Handle Change: Update the state based on user input in the form fields.
Handle Submit: Create a new book object and add it to the books array using the addBook function passed via props. Then reset the form.

Final Tips:
Remember to Use the this Keyword: When referring to state or props inside class components, use this.state, this.props, etc.
Use Controlled Components: Ensure that the form fields in AddBook.js are controlled components by linking them to the component's state.
Use map Properly: When mapping over the books array in Books.js, provide a unique key prop for each item in the list.
